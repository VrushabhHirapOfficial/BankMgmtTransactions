💥 MySQL JDBC – Communications link failure Error Fix

If you’re seeing this error when running the project:

Communications link failure

The last packet sent successfully to the server was 0 milliseconds ago. The driver has not received any packets from the server.

It means your Java program could not connect to the MySQL server.

⸻

✅ How to Fix It

Follow these steps to make sure your MySQL server is correctly configured and running:

⸻

1. 🔌 Start MySQL Server

Make sure your MySQL server is running on your system.
	•	On macOS using Homebrew:

brew services start mysql


	•	If installed via DMG:
	•	Go to System Preferences > MySQL > Start MySQL Server

⸻

2. 🔑 Verify Your JDBC Connection Details

In your Java code, make sure your database URL, user, and password are correct:

String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database_name";
String user = "your_mysql_user";
String password = "your_mysql_password";

Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password);

Checklist:
	•	✅ localhost is correct (or use your IP/domain if remote)
	•	✅ Port 3306 (default for MySQL) is correct
	•	✅ The database (your_database_name) exists
	•	✅ The user has access to that database
	•	✅ The password is correct

⸻

3. ⚙️ Check if MySQL is Listening on Port 3306

Run this command in terminal:

lsof -i :3306

If no output appears, MySQL is not running or listening on another port.

⸻

4. 🧪 Test MySQL Manually

Use the terminal to test connection manually:

mysql -u your_mysql_user -p

Enter your password when prompted. If it connects, you’re good.

5. ✅ Example JDBC Connection

String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/paise_send_karo";
String user = "root";
String password = "your_password";

Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password);


⸻

6. ❗ Additional Tips
	•	If you’re using MAMP/XAMPP, the port might be 8889 instead of 3306.
	•	Make sure no firewall is blocking port 3306.
	•	If using a remote MySQL server, ensure it’s configured to allow external connections (and not just localhost).

📌 Still Facing Issues?

Double-check your MySQL connector JAR:
	•	You must include the correct version (like mysql-connector-j-8.3.0.jar) in your classpath or lib/ folder.
